# Basil_data_LSTM_Roberta_SVM
In this repository, I have experimented on Basil Data using LSTM (Keras), Roberta (PyTorch/Huggingface), and SVM models.

Simply, you need to download and run the code in Python. Make sure all the files are in same directory.

Libraries you will need:
1. Pandas
2. Keras/TensorFlow
3. PyTorch/Hugginface
4. Scikit-Learn
