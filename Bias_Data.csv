"Paul Ryan went on offense Tuesday in response to criticism over his Medicare plan, using an interview with Fox News coupled with a new TV ad to claim President Obama's health care plan treats the treasured entitlement like a  piggy bank,  while the  Romney-Ryan  plan preserves it.",Informational
"Ryan, in his first one-on-one interview since being named Saturday as Mitt Romney's running mate, told Fox News on Tuesday he thinks Medicare can be a winning issue for their campaign.",Neutral

He added:  President Obama is actually damaging Medicare for current seniors.,Informational
"It's irrefutable and that's why I think this is a debate we want to have, and that's the debate we're going to win. ",Neutral
"The comments signal Ryan and Romney are prepared to dig in and fight back, as Democrats lob charges that Ryan stands for  ending Medicare as we know it. ",Neutral
"The Obama campaign used that line Monday in a Web video timed for Romney's arrival in Florida, with its large senior population.",Neutral
"The video pointed to Ryan's budget proposals, which include significant changes to Medicare.",Neutral
The Romney campaign retorted with an ad of its own Tuesday.,Neutral
"The ad says:  You paid in to Medicare for years ' now when you need it, Obama has cut $716 billion from Medicare.",Neutral
Why? To pay for ObamaCare. ,Informational
Ryan told Fox News the campaign is trying to show the  clear contrast  between what Republicans propose and what Obama's health care law does.,Neutral
Ryan wants to make changes to Medicare for those retiring a decade from now but leave benefits for current retirees and those retiring soon in place.,Neutral
" They turned Medicare into a piggy bank to finance ObamaCare,  Ryan said.",Informational
 And we want to point that out.,Neutral
And we want to ' restore those cuts to prevent that raid.,Neutral
 And so we propose no changes to anybody in or near retirement so that the guarantee of Medicare is for them.,Neutral
That's a clear contrast with President Obama's plan. ,Neutral
The Obama campaign is disputing that argument.,Neutral
"Obama campaign spokeswoman Lis Smith described the new Romney-Ryan ad on the subject as  dishonest and hypocritical,  considering Ryan's own proposals for Medicare.",Lexical
" The savings his ad attacks do not cut a single guaranteed Medicare benefit, and Mitt Romney embraced the very same savings when he promised he'd sign Paul Ryan's budget,  Smith said.",Neutral
" Because the president is eliminating subsidies to insurance companies and cutting waste and fraud, we've extended the life of Medicare by eight years.",Neutral
The truth is that the Romney-Ryan budget would end Medicare as we know it: people with Medicare would be left with nothing but a voucher in place of the guaranteed benefits they rely on today. ,Informational
Both sides are being selective in how they describe each other's plans.,Neutral
"The Ryan proposal, submitted again in the House earlier this year, would a decade from now give seniors government payments to purchase private plans or stay within the current system.",Neutral
"Ryan says this is to preserve Medicare, not  end  it, as Obama's campaign claims.",Neutral
"But while Ryan slams the health care overhaul for cutting Medicare, even he acknowledged that his own plan achieves  savings  for Medicare in the long run.",Neutral
"Though he doesn't use the word  cuts,  the plan would slow the rate of benefit growth for seniors according to the Congressional Budget Office.",Neutral
And the ObamaCare cuts he referenced would likely come in the form of lower payments to providers.,Neutral
"A Romney campaign aide, though, said  that's a distinction without a difference  since the  provider passes that reduction along to  patients.",Neutral
"In his interview with Fox News, Ryan also hammered Obama for what he called his  utter failure when it comes to creating jobs. ",Informational
"Amplifying the Romney campaign message, he said Obama's heavy borrowing is dragging down economic growth   he also claimed the  hope and change campaign of '08 has become the blame and attack campaign of 2012. ",Neutral
Ryan offered new insight as well on how Romney and Ryan came to bond in the months before he was announced as running mate.,Neutral
He recalled when he was campaigning with Romney earlier this year ahead of the Wisconsin primary.,Neutral
" We spent about five days on the road, five working hour or so days,  he said.",Neutral
" And in between all of those stops, driving from, you know, Appleton to Green Bay to Janesville to Milwaukee, we got to know each other.",Neutral
"We conversed on policy issues, on where to take the country.",Neutral
"And sooner or later, we basically started sharing the microphones at these town hall meetings and we just kind of developed a chemistry with one another and a mutual understanding with each other. ",Neutral
Ryan said he doesn't know whether he had a  special place  but it was  very clear we thought the same on these issues. ,Neutral
" When he asked me to join the ticket, he basically said to me, 'You share my values and you have the kind of experience that could be a complement to my experience to getting this country back on track, to creating jobs, to getting people back to work, to saving this country from a debt crisis,'"" Ryan said.",Neutral
"Ryan also discussed his affection for novelist Ayn Rand, saying  Atlas Shrugged  triggered his interest in economics.",Neutral
He said he doesn't share her overall philosophy but said her books  showed how the pitfalls of socialism can hurt the economy. ,Neutral
"Obama, meanwhile, took on Ryan for the second straight day Tuesday, using a stop in Oskaloosa, Iowa, to criticize Ryan's and Romney's tax plan.",Neutral
" You may have heard that Governor Romney just chose his running mate, Congressman Ryan.",Neutral
He's a good man. He's a family man.,Informational

"WASHINGTON -- In the wake of Mitt Romney's choice of Paul Ryan as his vice presidential nominee, the politics of Medicare have become almost as complicated as the policy itself.",Neutral
The most recent back-and-forth between the Romney and Obama campaigns concerns which candidate would do more harm to people's benefits.,Neutral
While the president's team has pointed to the Republican plan to turn Medicare into a quasi-voucher program -- in which recipients would receive a check to buy either insurance through the private market or traditional Medicare -- the Romney team has responded by noting that Obama took more than $700 billion out of Medicare as part of his health care overhaul.,Neutral
"""He stole $700 billion from Medicare to fund Obamacare,"" said RNC Chair Reince Priebus.",Lexical
"""If any person in this entire debate has blood on their hands in regard to Medicare, it's Barack Obama.""",Informational
That rejoinder is now a subject of intense debate.,Neutral
The money being taken out of the system by the Affordable Care Act is mostly derived from limiting the expected rate of growth in the program.,Neutral
"The savings come predominantly from limiting waste, fraud and abuse, mostly in Medicare Advantage, and are budgeted to help subsidize insurance for people under the ACA.",Neutral
"As such, independent fact-checkers and news analysts alike have disputed the Romney campaign's characterization.",Informational
"Part of the reason that the Obama campaign is crying foul over this line of criticism, however, may be because it knows how effective it can be.",Neutral
Republicans also used the charge that Obamacare raided Medicare as a primary attack line in the 2010 congressional elections.,Lexical
"Two years prior, then-Senator Obama used virtually identical language to beat up on his general election opponent, Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.):",Lexical
"""How would your golden years turn out under John McCain?",Neutral
His health care plan would cut Medicare by $800 billion -- that means a 22 percent cut in benefits.,Neutral
"Higher premiums and co-pays ... after a lifetime of work, senior's health care shouldn't be a gamble.",Neutral
"John McCain's plan, it's not the change we need.""",Neutral
Obama made the same argument on the stump.,Neutral
"""It turns out, Senator McCain would pay for part of his plan by making drastic cuts in Medicare: $882 billion worth -- $882 billion in Medicare cuts to pay for a ill-conceived, badly thought-through health care plan that won't provide more health care to people, even though Medicare is already facing a looming shortfall,"" Obama declared at a campaign stop in Roanoke, Va.",Neutral
"Douglas Holtz-Eakin, McCain's policy director at the time, recalled that the attack originated with a Wall Street Journal article that referenced his saying that McCain would assume savings in Medicare and Medicaid spending to make his health care plan budget neutral.",Neutral
Those savings were expected to come from eliminating fraud and reforming payment policies.,Neutral
The possibility of increasing Medicare premiums for higher-income earners was also floated.,Neutral
"FactCheck.org rated the Obama ad as ""false,"" noting that the McCain campaign wasn't talking about slashing benefits but limiting waste and slowing the rate of growth.",Informational
"Holtz-Eakin said, ""We were looking for efficiencies in delivery a la Managed Medicaid.""",Neutral
This was a relatively minor aspect of the Obama campaign's assault on McCain's Medicare record.,Lexical
The more substantive criticism concerned McCain's proposal to tax worker health care plans as a way of generating money to give people a new tax credit so that they could buy private insurance.,Neutral
"""Like Governor Romney has refused to specify how he will pay for his $5 trillion tax cuts weighted toward millionaires, Senator McCain would have cut $1.3 trillion from health care programs to pay for tax cuts while refusing to rule out cutting benefits or to say what he was cutting,"" Obama's current campaign press secretary, Ben LaBolt, said in an email to The Huffington Post.",Neutral
"""President Obama achieved a third as much savings by eliminating unnecessary subsidies to insurances companies and getting waste and fraud out of the system in order to improve seniors' benefits -- saving them $600 a year on prescription drugs and providing them with access to preventive care.",Neutral
"Senator McCain and Governor Romney have subsequently opposed the savings that the president identified and demagogued the issue, ironically, since Governor Romney's running mate kept them in his budget.""",Lexical
But the attack on McCain's accounting was part of the assault nonetheless.,Lexical
"And in light of the current debate over Medicare proposals, it could complicate the political dialogue even further.",Neutral
"Certainly, as the Washington Examiner's Phillip Klein notes, it will contribute to the general reluctance to talk substantively about Medicare reform out of a concern that it merely invites future attacks.",Neutral
"WASHINGTON - Representative Paul D. Ryan's budget blueprint assumes the same amount of Medicare savings as President Obama's health care law, even though Mitt Romney and Mr. Ryan have said those cuts would be devastating to millions of older Americans on Medicare",Neutral
"As the partisan brawl over Medicare continued on Tuesday and threatened to become the focus of the race, the Obama campaign said that Mr. Ryan's budget plan   broadly endorsed by Mr. Romney    would end Medicare as we know it  and shift costs to beneficiaries.",Informational
The Republicans hit back on Tuesday with a television commercial asserting that the Romney-Ryan Medicare plan was better for older Americans.,Neutral
" You paid into Medicare for years, every paycheck,  the advertisement says.",Neutral
" Now when you need it, Obama has cut $716 billion from Medicare.",Informational
Why? To pay for Obamacare.,Informational
So now the money you paid for your guaranteed health care is going to a massive new government program that's not for you. ,Informational

"With 50 million beneficiaries, Medicare is a major concern for both parties.",Neutral
"The current fight centers on changes in the program made in the new health law, the Affordable Care Act, passed in 2010 without Republican votes.",Neutral
"Mr. Obama would use the savings to help offset the cost of covering the uninsured, as well as to improve the financial condition of the Medicare trust fund.",Neutral
Mr. Ryan says he would use the money to shore up Medicare and to help reduce budget deficits.,Neutral
Republicans won control of the House in 2010 partly by arguing that Democrats had raided Medicare to pay for Mr. Obama's health care law.,Lexical
"Democrats hope to deflect such attacks this year by pointing out that Mr. Ryan's budget plan, approved twice by the House, includes similar savings   roughly $700 billion from 2013 to 2022, according to the Congressional Budget Office.",Neutral
Those savings have a complicated history.,Neutral
"Mr. Ryan's budget plan was approved in March by the House Budget Committee, of which he is chairman.",Neutral
"Before the vote, committee members discussed the budget plan and the Medicare provisions in detail.",Neutral
"Representative Allyson Y. Schwartz, Democrat of Pennsylvania, asked whether the savings in the Affordable Care Act    sometimes referred to as cuts to Medicare    were part of Mr. Ryan's budget.",Neutral
"Austin Smythe, the panel's Republican staff director, said:  We assume those savings.",Neutral
"We devote them to solvency of Medicare and to deficit reduction, instead of covering the expansions. ",Neutral
"At another point, Mr. Smythe said,  We assume the repeal of all of the expansions in the Affordable Care Act. ",Neutral

"The House approved the Ryan budget plan on March 29 by a vote of 228 to 191, with all but 10 Republicans voting for it.",Neutral
Mr. Romney has offered a Medicare proposal similar to Mr. Ryan's.,Neutral

" Mitt Romney and Paul Ryan have always been fully committed to repealing Obamacare, ending President Obama's $716 billion raid on Medicare, and tackling the serious fiscal challenges our country faces,  said Lanhee Chen, the policy director for the Romney campaign.",Neutral
 A Romney-Ryan administration will restore the funding to Medicare. ,Neutral
"The Ryan plan, like any budget resolution, specifies levels of spending, savings and revenues, based on certain policy assumptions.",Neutral
"But, as Mr. Smythe pointed out,  the committees of jurisdiction determine the details  in separate legislation.",Neutral
"Mr. Ryan and Mr. Obama would impose similar overall constraints on Medicare spending, stipulating that average spending per beneficiary should not grow faster than the economy, measured by the per capita output of goods and services, plus one-half of one percentage point.",Neutral
"However, they would achieve the goal in different ways.",Neutral
Mr. Ryan and Mr. Romney would limit the government's current open-ended financial commitment to Medicare.,Neutral
"The government would contribute a fixed amount of money on behalf of each beneficiary, and future beneficiaries could use the money to buy private insurance or to help pay for coverage under the traditional Medicare program.",Neutral
"The new health care law, by contrast, will reduce projected Medicare payments to health maintenance organizations, hospitals and many other health care providers.",Neutral
"As a backstop, to ensure savings, the law creates a Medicare cost control board.",Neutral
Cuts recommended by the board would take effect automatically unless Congress voted to block or change them.,Neutral

"Even for a Congress known to battle over every little detail, reading the U.S. Constitution aloud sounded like a simple exercise.",Informational
Turned out it wasn't.,Neutral
Newly sworn members of the House reading aloud the country's founding document on Thursday didn't recite every verse and article of the document because Republicans decided that the obsolete parts can be skipped since they've been superseded by amendment.,Neutral
"For instance, lawmakers did not read the 18th Amendment, which imposed prohibition on liquor in 1919.",Neutral
"However, they did read the 21st Amendment, which repealed prohibition in 1933 and is still in force.",Neutral
Republicans also left out the part about counting slaves and Native Americans as three-fifths of a person.,Neutral

Trump fired Flynn in February because he misled Vice President Mike Pence about conversations he had with Russia's ambassador about potentially easing economic sanctions.,Neutral
Flynn is also being investigated over whether he was fully forthcoming about his foreign contacts and earnings from organizations linked to the governments of Russia and Turkey.,Neutral

The Senate committee responded with two additional subpoenas on Tuesday targeting Flynn's businesses.,Neutral
"The House committee's subpoenas  will be designed to maximize our chance of getting the information that we need,  Schiff told reporters at a breakfast hosted by the Christian Science Monitor.",Neutral
" We need to use whatever compulsory mechanism necessary to get the information he possesses ' the Fifth Amendment right not to provide materials or documents is limited,  he added.",Neutral
Schiff said he is  skeptical  that the committee would agree to grant Flynn immunity in the future in exchange for information.,Neutral
The committee is also looking for ways to obtain documentation of Trump's conversations with top intelligence and law enforcement officials involved in a separate federal Russia probe.,Neutral
Trump implied earlier this month that he had  tapes  of discussions with recently fired FBI Director James Comey that would be damaging to Comey.,Neutral
And the Washington Post reported earlier this week that Trump asked Director of National Intelligence Dan Coats and National Security Agency Director Mike Rogers to push back on the FBI's Russia investigation.,Neutral
" That could be further evidence of an attempt to interfere with the investigation,  Schiff said of Trump's reported request to Coats and Rogers.",Neutral
He also referred to past reports that the White House asked allies on Capitol Hill to refute negative press stories about Trump associates' ties to Russia.,Neutral
" If all of this is part of a pattern by the White House of interference or worse, that's something that we have to find out about and it's something we have to stop,  he said.",Neutral
"Despite concerns about Trump interfering with ongoing investigations into his campaign, Schiff warned that it is premature for Democrats on Capitol Hill to push for impeachment.",Neutral
" There's a legal standard that needs to be met for impeachment and then there's a very practical standard that has to be met,  Schiff said.",Neutral
"Practically speaking, he continued, impeachment is only possible if Republican lawmakers and the general public believe Trump is unfit for office.",Neutral

" Those subpoenas will be designed to maximize our chance of getting the information that we need,  Mr. Schiff told reporters during a breakfast hosted by The Christian Science Monitor.",Neutral
 And I think we need to use whatever compulsory methods are necessary to get the information that he possesses. ,Neutral

Mr. Conaway has repeatedly refused to comment on the details of the investigation while it is continuing.,Neutral

"On Monday, Mr. Flynn, in a letter from his legal team, rejected a subpoena for documents from the Senate committee, citing the Fifth Amendment's protections against self-incrimination.",Neutral

Mr. Flynn's legal troubles have only mounted in recent days.,Neutral
"On Monday, it was revealed that he had misled Pentagon investigators about his foreign contacts and sources of income while seeking a renewed security clearance in February 2016.",Neutral

But former U.S. attorney for the District of Columbia Joseph diGenova blasted the tactic as  outrageous. ,Neutral

"WASHINGTON   President Trump, facing a growing public backlash over the partial government shutdown, shifted course on Saturday and offered Democrats a deal: temporary protections for roughly 700,000 young undocumented immigrants in exchange for $5.7 billion in funding for a wall along the southern border.",Neutral
"But the proposal, which Mr. Trump unveiled in a 13-minute address from the White House, appeared dead on arrival in the Capitol.",Neutral
"Speaker Nancy Pelosi rejected it even before Mr. Trump spoke, and Senator Chuck Schumer, the Democratic leader, denounced the offer as  not a compromise but more hostage taking. ",Informational
"With the shutdown entering its fifth week and polls showing a majority of the public blaming Mr. Trump, the president's advisers have been searching for an exit strategy.",Neutral
"Saturday's speech grew out of talks that Vice President Mike Pence and the president's son-in-law and senior adviser, Jared Kushner, have had in recent days with lawmakers including Senator Mitch McConnell, the majority leader.",Neutral
The proposal was Mr. Trump's first public offer to Democrats since the partial shutdown began nearly a month ago.,Neutral
"It came after an acrimonious week of tit-for-tat politics, in which Ms. Pelosi told the president he could not deliver his State of the Union address in the Capitol until the shutdown was over, and the president retaliated by grounding a plane that was supposed to take Ms. Pelosi on a fact-finding mission to Afghanistan.",Informational
"In casting the plan as a compromise, the president sought to shift pressure to Democrats   who have repeatedly refused to give Mr. Trump any money for his border wall   to end the shutdown.",Neutral
But Democrats continued to insist they will not negotiate with Mr. Trump over border security until the government reopens.,Neutral
"Over the course of his administration, Mr. Trump has repeatedly sought to curb both legal and illegal immigration.",Neutral
"He has revoked Temporary Protected Status, or T.P.S., which offers crucial protections for immigrants, for people from some Latin American and African countries.",Neutral
"And he has moved to rescind Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, or DACA, an Obama-era program that shielded the young undocumented immigrants known as Dreamers from deportation.",Neutral
"In the deal he outlined on Saturday, Mr. Trump offered to restore T.P.S. protection for 300,000 people, and said he would allow 700,000 Dreamers to keep their protections for three more years in exchange for $5.7 billion for a border barrier.",Neutral
" That is our plan,  Mr. Trump said.",Neutral
" Border security, DACA, T.P.S. Many other things.",Neutral
"Straightforward, fair, reasonable and common sense with lots of compromise. ",Neutral
"The proposal, Mr. Trump added, was intended to  break the logjam and provide Congress with a path forward. ",Neutral
The speech was the second time during the shutdown that the president addressed the nation about the immigration crisis.,Neutral
"But unlike his first address, a prime-time broadcast from the Oval Office that leaned heavily on dark messaging about the dangers of crime and illegal drugs flowing across the border, Mr. Trump seemed on Saturday to soften his tone.",Informational
"He paired the address with his first naturalization ceremony at the White House, a move intended to underscore the idea that he supports legal immigration.",Neutral
"And his language was markedly different; instead of insisting on the  big beautiful wall  he promised during his 2016 campaign, Mr. Trump took care to use the word  barrier  as well   and seemed to pare back his vision for it.",Neutral
"Calling the wall  a powerful and beautifully designed see-through steel barrier on our southern border,  Mr. Trump said:  This is not a 2,000-mile concrete structure from sea to sea.",Neutral
These are steel barriers in high priority locations.,Neutral
Much of the border is already protected by natural barriers such as mountains and water. ,Neutral
Mr. Trump noted that he had adopted some Democratic proposals on border security.,Neutral
"The president proposed $800 million for humanitarian assistance and $805 million for drug detection technology, in addition to funding for 2,750 more border agents and law enforcement officials and 75 new immigration judge teams.",Neutral
"In her talking points, issued to Democrats, Ms. Pelosi said her party favored  new drug, weapons and contraband scanning technology at official ports of entry,  and  filling the more than 3,000 vacancies for customs officers. ",Neutral
"Ms. Pelosi also intends to bring up legislation in the coming days that includes an additional $1 billion for border security, including $563 million for 75 new immigration judges and support staff.",Neutral
"Even so, Democrats roundly criticized the president's plan.",Informational
They were particularly incensed that Mr. Trump's offer extended protections to Dreamers and T.P.S. recipients that he himself revoked.,Neutral
And they said the deal was a nonstarter because it did not offer any permanent protections for Dreamers.,Neutral
" I think it's simply more fake promises raising false hopes,  Senator Richard Blumenthal, Democrat of Connecticut, said.",Informational
 It will fool few Americans because it's neither serious nor credible as a real remedy for Dreamers. ,Informational
"Some on the right also pushed back, describing the proposal as amnesty.",Neutral
"James Carafano, a national security expert at the Heritage Foundation who worked on Mr. Trump's transition, was among the critics.",Neutral
" Amnesty encourages further illegal immigration, incentivizes the tragedy of human trafficking and undermines our citizens' confidence in the rule of law,  he said.",Neutral
"Mr. Pence, briefing reporters after Mr. Trump's remarks, said the speech reflected a painstaking process of listening to lawmakers, including rank-and-file Democrats who made it clear they believed that protections for DACA and T.P.S. recipients must be included in a border security deal.",Neutral
And he pushed back forcefully against critics like Mr. Carafano who said the measure amounted to an unacceptable amnesty for undocumented immigrants.,Neutral
" There is no pathway to citizenship in this proposal,  Mr. Pence said.",Neutral
But that was one reason many Democrats considered it unacceptable.,Neutral
Other senior administration officials made it clear that part of Mr. Trump's strategy was to try to drive a wedge within the party between those who want to hold out for a much more generous solution and those who may feel enough political pressure to end the shutdown that they will feel obliged to support it.,Neutral
"Noting that Tuesday is the deadline for the government to reopen in time to prevent federal employees from going a second consecutive pay period without a check, Mick Mulvaney, the acting chief of staff, said Senate Democrats had a tricky decision to make.",Neutral
He also noted that the president's ability to declare a national emergency was  absolutely  still a tool available to Mr. Trump to find funds to build the wall if a legislative agreement could not be reached.,Neutral
Now it will be up to Mr. McConnell to put legislation incorporating Mr. Trump's proposal on the Senate floor.,Neutral
"Mr. McConnell   who has insisted he will not put any legislation on the floor unless the president will sign it   spoke to Mr. Trump, Mr. Kushner and Mr. Pence on Thursday night about finding a way forward.",Neutral
"Mr. McConnell told the president that before he could bring up legislation on the Senate floor, he needed a  public reassurance  that Mr. Trump would sign it, one person close to the talks said, speaking on the condition of anonymity to describe sensitive discussions.",Neutral
"The president's proposal  strikes a fair compromise by incorporating priorities from both sides of the aisle,  Mr. McConnell said in a statement after Mr. Trump's speech.",Neutral
"If Mr. McConnell does indeed put a bill on the floor, as the president said he would, Senate Democrats will have to decide whether to block it or let it come up for a vote.",Neutral
"Despite Democrats' vow to reject the measure, it could create an opening for negotiations between the two sides.",Neutral
"The shutdown stalemate is creating increasing nervousness on Capitol Hill, especially among Republicans seeking re-election in Democratic-leaning states.",Neutral
"One of them, Senator Susan Collins of Maine, is among only a handful of Republicans who have broken with the president and called for the government to reopen without a border security deal.",Neutral
"On Saturday, she praised the president, saying she hoped that Mr. Trump's offer would  lead to constructive debate that will end this impasse. ",Neutral
"White House aides and allies of Mr. Trump said Saturday that Mr. Trump succeeded in ratcheting up the political pressure on Ms. Pelosi, especially if the Senate succeeded in passing a bill.",Neutral
" The Democrats' talking points have been that the president is solely responsible for shutting down the government,  Marc Short, the former White House legislative director, said.",Neutral
 This puts more onus on them to come back and say why this proposal is insufficient. ,Neutral
But one reason Democrats are so leery of the deal is that they have been down this road with the president before.,Neutral
"Last year, Mr. Trump and Mr. Schumer negotiated $25 billion in wall money for a pathway to citizenship for the Dreamers.",Neutral
But that deal fell apart when hard-line White House advisers persuaded the president to back away.,Neutral
"The standoff over the shutdown, some former aides noted, was the first time Mr. Trump has had to engage in meaningful, high-stakes negotiations.",Neutral
"But even that has come as a last resort, in what some have likened to negotiating out of desperation after failing to score political points.",Informational
President Obama was heading to Detroit Monday afternoon to continue campaigning for tax hikes on top earners -- a day after a face-to-face meeting with House Speaker John Boehner that offered slight hope the two could be making progress toward a deal.,Neutral

Boehner last week put a counter-proposal on the table that included $800 billion in revenue increases over the next decade.,Neutral
"While Boehner cast that as a significant concession, Obama said it didn't go far enough because it didn't include an increase in tax rates for the top 2 percent.",Neutral
"Boehner, though, is facing some pressure from Republicans to give a little bit more.",Neutral
The speaker is effectively caught between two competing wings of the Republican Party.,Neutral
"Some say Congress should not raise any taxes, and were disappointed he went so far as to put any revenue on the table.",Neutral
"However, a growing number of Republicans are suggesting the party should give Obama what he wants on tax rates -- and focus instead on winning entitlement cuts once that is cleared away.",Neutral

Corker suggested that Republicans instead focus on extracting entitlement cuts as part of the debt-ceiling negotiations.,Neutral
"""Republicans know that they have the debt ceiling that's coming up right around the corner, and the leverage is going to shift, as soon as we get beyond this issue,"" Corker said on ""Fox News Sunday.""",Neutral
"""The leverage is going to shift to our side, where hopefully we'll do the same thing we did last time.""",Neutral

"After the bruising debt-ceiling fight from 2011, Obama recently warned that he will not ""play that game"" again.",Neutral
"""We've got to break that habit before it starts,"" the president said.",Neutral

"WASHINGTON   With just three weeks left for lawmakers to avert a fiscal crisis, President Obama and Speaker John A. Boehner met privately at the White House on Sunday as a top Republican senator suggested that his party should perhaps accede to Mr. Obama's demand to raise the top tax rates so that the attention can shift to making serious cuts in benefit programs like Medicare and Medicaid.",Neutral
Administration officials would not offer details of the discussion between Mr. Obama and Mr. Boehner.,Neutral
"But the disclosure of the meeting indicated that private discussions continue in the face of Republican leaders' public statements deploring the lack of progress and the president's refusal so far to specify the sort of deep, long-term reductions in spending for social programs that they insist upon as a condition of their support for raising taxes on high earners.",Neutral
The White House and Mr. Boehner's office issued identical statements afterward that said  the lines of communication remain open. ,Neutral

"Just hours before the White House meeting, Senator Bob Corker, Republican of Tennessee, said on  Fox News Sunday  that a small but growing group of Republicans had begun considering acquiescing on tax rates so that the negotiations could shift to entitlement programs.",Neutral
"Mr. Corker, a member of the Banking Committee who had presented a deficit-reduction plan of his own, said that if Republicans gave in to the president's chief demand, then  all of a sudden the shift goes back to entitlements, and maybe it puts us in a place where we actually can do something that really saves the nation. ",Neutral
Republicans have been insisting that the Obama administration agree to substantial savings in entitlement programs as the two sides negotiate how to narrow the country's huge deficits.,Neutral
"But Mr. Corker is part of a group of Republicans who say the party will ultimately have to yield to the Obama demand of higher tax rates for top earners, potentially back to the levels that prevailed under President Bill Clinton.",Neutral
"That group of Republicans, Mr. Corker said on Fox, was beginning to realize  that we don't have a lot of cards as it relates to the tax issue before year end    but that a tax-rate concession could be converted, jujitsu style, into a tactical advantage.",Neutral

"WASHINGTON  - The White House on Wednesday released the full set of emails surrounding the Obama administration's development of talking points describing the Sept. 11, 2012, attack on the U.S. outpost in Benghazi, Libya, in response to continuing charges from congressional Republicans that there was a massive political  cover-up  of what transpired there.",Lexical
Nothing in the emails supports theories that the talking points were changed in order to influence the 2012 election.,Informational
"In a briefing with reporters at the White House on Wednesday afternoon, senior administration officials used the 100 pages of emails to show that a number of government agencies, not just the State Department, drove many of the changes to the talking points that were ultimately used by U.N. Ambassador Susan Rice.",Neutral
"The cache of emails paint a fuller picture than did an email leaked earlier this week, which portrayed a State Department concerned about its public image.",Neutral
Republican lawmakers have argued that the State Department and the White House were attempting to alter the talking points for political reasons and ignored suggestions and language put forward by the CIA.,Lexical
"In particular, they pointed to the fact that references to al Qaeda and previous security warnings were removed.",Neutral
But senior administration officials stressed on Wednesday that such language in fact was taken out at the request of the CIA.,Neutral
Critics have said the role of State Department spokeswoman Victoria Nuland in revising the talking points in particular shows an administration trying to protect its reputation as being tough on terrorism.,Informational
"They have criticized Nuland for requesting to remove a line from the final draft noting that there had been ""at least five other attacks against foreign interests in Benghazi by unidentified assailants.""",Neutral
"Nuland said in a Sept. 14 email that she didn't want that information included because it ""could be abused by members [of Congress] to beat up the State Department for not paying attention to warnings, so why would we want to feed that either? Concerned ...""",Neutral
"But senior administration officials on Wednesday said that Michael J. Morell, then the deputy director of the CIA, also wanted that line removed, separately from Nuland.",Neutral
Morell believed it was irrelevant to the message of the talking points -- what happened in Benghazi -- and unprofessional to include those warnings but not allow State Department officials to include how they had responded to them.,Informational
"Separate from Wednesday's document release, the CIA recently conducted an internal review of how and why the talking points were changed -- a move that also came in response to the continuing questions from Congress.",Neutral
"That review showed that many changes were made to the original talking points -- drafted by a senior officer -- over concerns about accuracy, an FBI investigation and other bureaucratic matters.",Neutral
"A U.S. intelligence official told The Huffington Post the review was completed ""early this year.""",Neutral
"Senior administration officials, discussing that internal review, relayed that some CIA officials didn't like that the original draft of the talking points said the government ""know[s] that Islamic extremists with ties to al-Qa'ida participated in the attack,"" because at that time it was premature to name those responsible for the attacks.",Neutral
Their concerns at other times were more mundane.,Neutral
"For example, CIA officials also decided to change the phrase ""attacks in Benghazi ... evolved into a direct assault against the US Consulate"" to ""demonstrations in Benghazi"" because they believed ""attacks"" and ""assault"" were synonymous, making the phrase illogical.",Neutral
CIA officers also removed the reference to al Qaeda in order to avoid prejudging the outcome of a FBI investigation into the incident.,Neutral
"A reference to another terrorist group, Ansar al-Sharia, was left in, but later removed at the request of the State Department; the CIA agreed with that decision, again so as not to hinder the FBI investigation.",Neutral
The timing of the White House's document release raises its own set of questions.,Neutral
"Why, for example, did the administration choose to make the emails public now, after months of enduring criticism and requests for more information?",Neutral
"If the material was too sensitive to share publicly months, weeks or days ago, what changed on Wednesday?",Neutral
"While the document dump does soften some of the more critical theories that have arisen with respect to the White House's handling of the events in Benghazi, it could also embolden critics who now see an administration willing to accommodate demands for documents.",Neutral
"In a response shortly after the emails were made public on Wednesday, Brendan Buck, spokesman for House Speaker John Boehner (R-Ohio), said just that.",Neutral
"""The House interim report found that 'senior State Department officials requested the talking points be changed to avoid criticism for ignoring the threat environment in Benghazi' and that those changes were ultimately made,"" said Buck.",Neutral
"""Those findings are confirmed by the emails released today, and they contradict statements made by the White House that it and the State Department only changed one word in the talking points.",Neutral

"The e-mails revealed no new details about the administration's evolving account of the Sept. 11 attack, which killed four Americans, including Ambassador J. Christopher Stevens.",Neutral

"By releasing them, he said, the White House had shown that the drafting process was  focused on providing the facts as we knew them, based on the best information available at the time and protecting an ongoing investigation. ",Neutral
"Still, the final version of the talking points is stripped of material   including a reference to Libya being awash with weapons and fighters that made it a dangerous environment   which critics say would have raised questions about the State Department's security posture.",Neutral
"Republicans welcomed the release of the e-mails, saying they confirmed that the administration had airbrushed its account of the attack during an election campaign.",Lexical

"It also claims that despite a company policy expressly prohibiting discrimination, local store managers are given too much flexibility in determining salary hikes and job promotions that invariably favor men over women.",Neutral

"""If somebody tells you how to exercise discretion, you don't have discretion,"" he said.",Neutral
"Chief Justice John Roberts also offered his doubts about the merits of lawsuit, suggesting that any discriminatory acts at Wal-Mart are no worse than anywhere else.",Neutral
"""Is it true that Wal-Mart's pay disparity across the company was less than the national average?"" he asked.",Neutral
Sellers said that wasn't a fair comparison because Wal-Mart has an obligation under federal law to make sure its managers do not discriminate.,Neutral

Much of the hour-long argument delved into the tedious details of class action law and if the Wal-Mart women could properly certify their claims into a single case.,Neutral
Wal-Mart lawyer Theodore Boutrous argued that every member of the class couldn't possibly meet a standard of commonality to justify the lawsuit.,Neutral
"""Our expert's report and testimony showed that at 90 percent of the stores, there was no pay disparity,"" Boutrous told the court.",Neutral
"""And that's the kind of -- and even putting that aside, the plaintiffs needed to come forward with something that showed that there was this miraculous recurrence at every decision across every store of stereotyping, and the evidence simply doesn't show that.""",Neutral
Another technical concern that appears to work against the women covers the different types of remedies they are seeking.,Neutral
In addition to the punitive damages they want an injunction that would force Wal-Mart to adopt more stringent anti-discrimination policies.,Neutral
"But those two remedies require different standards for class certification and Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg said it was ""a very serious problem"" in the case to try and sue for punitive damages after only obtaining certification under the lower threshold required for the injunction.",Neutral
"It's possible that instead of an outright victory for Wal-Mart, the justices could issue a split decision of sorts and allow only the injunction part of the lawsuit to move forward.",Neutral
That potential ruling would get Wal-Mart off the hook for any financial damages.,Neutral
"WASHINGTON   The Supreme Court appears ready to block a massive sex discrimination lawsuit against Wal-Mart on behalf of up to 1.6 million women, and that could make it harder for other workers nationwide to bring class-action claims against large employers.",Neutral

Billions of dollars are at stake if it is allowed to go forward.,Neutral
The case also could affect the future of other class-action lawsuits that pool modest individual claims into a single action that creates the potential for a large judgment and increases the pressure on businesses to settle.,Neutral

Sellers said that lower courts had been persuaded by statistical and other evidence put forth so far in the lawsuit.,Neutral
"He said Wal-Mart's strong corporate culture stereotypes women as less aggressive than men and that translates into individual pay and promotion decisions at the more than 4,300 Wal-Mart and Sam's Club stores across the country.",Neutral
"""The decisions are informed by the values the company provides,"" Sellers said.",Neutral
"Justice Antonin Scalia said he felt ""whipsawed"" by Sellers' description.",Neutral

"Ginsburg, who made her name as a lawyer by bringing discrimination claims, said it was possible that Wal-Mart could refute the claims at a trial.",Neutral
"The court's other two female justices, Elena Kagan and Sonia Sotomayor, and Justice Stephen Breyer also appeared inclined to allow the lawsuit to proceed.",Neutral
"But several of their more conservative colleagues appeared to agree with Theodore Boutrous Jr., representing Wal-Mart, that even subjecting the company to a trial would be unfair.",Neutral
That split among the justices raised the prospect of an ideologically divided ruling by the court this summer.,Neutral
Boutrous said the class-action nature of the case deprives the company of its legal rights because it is being forced to defend the treatment of female employees regardless of the jobs they hold or where they work.,Neutral
"""There is absolutely no way there can be a fair process here,"" Boutrous said.",Informational
"He pointed to a group of at least 544 women who serve as store managers who ""are alleged to be both discriminators and victims.""",Neutral

WASHINGTON   The Supreme Court appeared closely divided on Tuesday during arguments over the theory put forth by the plaintiffs in an enormous sex discrimination class-action case against Wal-Mart.,Neutral
Even some justices who seemed sympathetic to the plaintiffs expressed qualms about how to administer a lawsuit involving as many as 1.5 million women seeking back pay that could amount to billions of dollars.,Informational
Others appeared worried about the consequences for other businesses of a ruling that would allow the case against Wal-Mart to go forward.,Neutral
"The mere certification of a class-action suit can prompt defendants to settle in light of the sums at stake, and the justices struggled to find a way to distinguish between gaps in pay that might have benign explanations and those caused by unlawful discrimination.",Neutral
The court of Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr. has recently issued a series of rulings in favor of plaintiffs suing for employment discrimination that cut against the court's pro-business reputation.,Neutral
The Wal-Mart case dwarfs those rulings in importance.,Neutral
"It is the largest employment discrimination class action in history, and the court's decision, expected by June, will probably be its most important business ruling this term.",Neutral
"The issue before the justices at Tuesday's arguments was not whether Wal-Mart, the country's largest retailer and biggest private employer, discriminated against women who worked there.",Neutral
"For now, the question in the case, Wal-Mart Stores v. Dukes, No. 10-277, is whether hundreds of thousands of female workers have enough in common to join together in a single lawsuit.",Neutral
"The plaintiffs' theory is that a centralized companywide policy gave local managers too much discretion in pay and promotion decisions, leaving Wal-Mart vulnerable to gender stereotypes.",Neutral
The plaintiffs have presented sworn statements and statistics to support their claim.,Neutral
Wal-Mart calls that evidence unrepresentative and unreliable.,Lexical
The company says its policies expressly bar discrimination and promote diversity.,Neutral
"In any event, the company says, the plaintiffs   who worked in 3,400 stores in 170 job classifications   do not have enough in common to warrant class-action treatment.",Neutral
Justice Anthony M. Kennedy said the theory about how the company discriminated   through a central policy conferring local discretion   was internally inconsistent.,Neutral
" Your complaint faces in two directions,  he told a lawyer for the plaintiffs.",Neutral
But Justice Stephen G. Breyer said Wal-Mart could be held accountable if it failed to take action in the face of reports of discrimination from its stores.,Neutral
 Should central management under the law have withdrawn some of the subjective discretion in order to stop these results?  Justice Breyer asked.,Neutral
"Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg agreed, saying that companies had a responsibility to make sure that women were treated fairly in local workplaces.",Neutral
And Justice Elena Kagan said that  excessive subjectivity  may be a policy that violates the civil rights laws.,Neutral
But Justice Antonin Scalia was unconvinced.,Neutral
" I'm getting whipsawed here,  he told the plaintiffs' lawyer, Joseph M. Sellers.",Neutral
" On the one hand, you say the problem is that they were utterly subjective, and on the other hand you say there is strong corporate culture that guides all of this. Well, which is it? ",Neutral
"Mr. Sellers responded that  there is this broad discretion given the managers  but that  they do not make their decisions in a vacuum.  Managers, he went on,  are informed by the company about how to exercise that discretion. ",Neutral
That did not satisfy Justice Scalia.,Neutral
" If somebody tells you how to exercise discretion,  he said,  you don't have discretion. ",Neutral
"Theodore J. Boutrous Jr., a lawyer for Wal-Mart, said the handful of women named as plaintiffs who seek to represent the entire class did not have typical experiences at the company.",Neutral
" Each of the plaintiffs have very different stories,  he said.",Neutral
 One of them was promoted into a managerial position. One was terminated for disciplinary violations. One was promoted and then had a disciplinary problem and then was demoted. ,Informational
He added that  this class includes at least 544 store managers who are alleged to be discriminators and victims. ,Neutral
Several justices had practical concerns.,Neutral
" What seems to me a very serious problem in this case is, how do you work out the back pay?  Justice Ginsburg asked.",Neutral
"Mr. Sellers said the trial court could rely on statistics culled from company databases, which he said were more reliable than the evidence that might be presented in individualized hearings given the available information about particular pay and promotion decisions.",Neutral
"Memories have faded, he said, and Wal-Mart did not keep good records.",Neutral
"Given that, Mr. Sellers said, Wal-Mart's personnel decisions were  standardless  and  recordless. ",Lexical
Justice Kennedy responded with a point about the suitability of the case for class-action treatment.,Neutral
" If it's standardless and recordless,  he said,  then why is there commonality? ",Neutral
Mr. Boutrous said Mr. Sellers was trying to have it both ways.,Neutral
" The problem here, Mr. Sellers says, is that the records are not available,  Mr. Boutrous said.",Neutral
" Then he says we're going to have a proceeding where the district judge relies only on the records that he says are inadequate, to allow a reconstruction of the decision.",Neutral
That is not a process known to our jurisprudence.,Neutral
It doesn't comport with due process.,Neutral
Several justices voiced concerns about how many companies could be subject to class-action suits if they allowed the case against Wal-Mart to go forward.,Neutral
" Is it true,  Chief Justice Roberts asked Mr. Sellers,  that Wal-Mart's pay disparity across the company was less than the national average? ",Neutral
"Mr. Sellers said that was not the appropriate comparison.  The comparison that's relevant,  he said,  is between men and women and Wal-Mart. ",Neutral
He added later that  Wal-Mart was behind the other large retailers. ,Neutral
The chief justice also asked Mr. Sellers  how many examples of abuse of the subjective discrimination delegation need to be shown before you can say that flows from the policy rather than from bad actors? ,Neutral
"After all, he said,  you're going to have some bad apples  given Wal-Mart's thousands of stores.",Neutral
Mr. Sellers responded that  there is no minimum number  in court decisions.,Neutral
Justices Kennedy and Samuel A. Alito Jr. said they were concerned about companies whose pay and promotion gaps mirror national numbers where there is no proof of a discriminatory policy.,Neutral
" So, you have the company that is absolutely typical of the entire American work force,  Justice Alito said.",Neutral
 Then you would say every single company is in violation of Title VII  of the Civil Rights Act?,Neutral
